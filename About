UML Diagram Generator

This tool analyzes java code and generates a UML diagram. It detects and draws all classes complete with their fields and methods. It also draws 
arrows for inheritance from other classes, implementation of interfaces, other used classes, and other associated classes. The Singleton, 
Decorator, Adapter, and Composite design patterns are also detected and notated.  

This program was written by Thomas Bonatti, Jesse Shellabarger, and Nate Briggs in 2016 for CSSE374.
